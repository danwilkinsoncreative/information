# Solid Vision 

Solidâ€™s vision is to make it possible for users online to have many options about how to use the Web. 

# Solid Mission 

To explain how to technically build apps that are separate to data storage in such a way that the data could be conveniently recycled by the user. 

# Solid Values 

* Self-determination

Users should be able to move seamlessly between online services without interruption. Users should be able to chose a from a variety of services that work together with other services. Users should be able to change their mind about which service they use and take their data along with them in a convenient way.  

Users should have the freedom to determine the following about data generated while they use an online service: where data is sored, who has access to its and how it is used. They should also have the ability to share any part of their user data with any other user, organisation or service without constraint, manipulation or restriction of choice. Granularity of these decisions is key.

Online services including storage of data, identification online, and use of data for an application should always be interoperable with each other. Data should slot seamlessly from one Solid app or Pod to another without permission from each other. Solid app and Pod providers should be able to easily innovate by creating new apps or improving current apps, all while reusing existing data that was created by other apps. Unnecessary technical hurdles or business opportunities should not be used as an excuse to not provide interoperability.

* Fairness

Online interactions should be fair for everyone involved both for consumption and creation i.e. the read-write web. While development may require education this should also be freely available and accessible to all.

The web should be available everywhere and should be indiscriminate in the way it operates and speaks to everyone. 

Users should not be subject to any bias, discrimination or missuse of their unique data. Everyone should be given equal access to their data and the same privileges in terms of how they manage their data, how they share it and the value extracted from it. Personal data usage should not infringe on the freedom or rights of any individual be they the owner of that data or associated to it. 

* Practicality 

There should be a minimum number of rules. Rules should be essential to providing what is essential to the mission. 

Users should be able to easily control and manage their unique data, its usage and access privileges regardless of their ability or understanding. Functionality, processes and communications should be accessible to all and add value to everyday tasks or experiences.
