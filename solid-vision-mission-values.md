# What is Solid? 

Solid is a global technical standard for building interoperable software. It aims to rest control of where user data resides, who it is used by and to what end to the users themselves. Solid-compliant applications allow users to securely move to other applications at will and take their user data with them. Users are also given autonomy over how that user data is accessed by others.

Solid is led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, and originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is a non-commerical, open source collaboration between thousands of expert contributors from around the globe.

Solid works on three levels:

1.	Login: Users identify themselves using a WebID which is a domain name based alternative to a password. Ideally the user owns the domain used to identify themselves. This avoids the need for user login credentials being held by 3rd parties.
2.	Pods: Users store their unique data on Pods (personal online data stores) rather than centralised data stores e.g. Google, Facebook. Users can have multiple Pods. Data generated while using Solid-compliant applications is stored on the Pod independently of the application. This means that user data can be moved freely to other services or apps without constraint.
3.	Apps: Solid-compliant applications have granular access to user data meaning they only get a specific type of data, for a specific purpose and for a set timeframe. This means users have much greater control over how their data is accessed.

# Solid Mission 

To set a global standard for interoperability against which all applications are built

# Solid Vision 

A future where everyone has complete freedom of movement for their user data and choice in how it is used.

# Solid Values 

* Freedom 

Users should have the right to move seemlessly between applications and services without interruption or constraint. They should also have the freedom to choose how that data is accessed and used by third-parties.

Data should slot seamlessly from one Solid app or Pod to another without permission from each other. Solid app and Pod providers should be able to easily innovate by creating new apps or improving current apps, all while reusing existing data that was created by other apps. 

Unnecessary technical hurdles or business opportunities should not be used as an excuse to not provide interoperability.  

* Self-determination 

Users should have the right to determine where their user data is stored, who has access to it, how it is used and for how long. Granularity of these decisions, as well as being presented with multiple options, is important for that self determination to be valid. 

Users should be able to use Solid in a way that works for them and shouldnâ€™t be subject to doctrine, dictation or directive.

Solid does not define which data should be controlled by which user.

* Equality

Users should have equal access to the web both for consumption and creation i.e. the read-write web. While development may require education this should also be freely available and accessible to all.

The web should be available everywhere and should be indiscriminate in the way it operates and speaks to everyone.

Users can be anything from a person, to a company, to a government.
